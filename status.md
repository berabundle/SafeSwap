# SafeSwap Project Status

## Major Architecture Update ✅

The application has been refactored to use Safe's native transaction bundling instead of a custom bundler contract.

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Berabundle Contract**
   - No longer using `Berabundle_SwapBundler` contract
   - Deleted `BerabundlerService.ts` and contracts folder
   - Removed `SwapOperation` type

2. **New Architecture**
   - Created `SwapBundleService.ts` for Safe-native bundling
   - Uses parallel API calls to get swap quotes quickly
   - Creates individual approve + swap transactions
   - Leverages Safe's built-in transaction batching

3. **Transaction Flow**
   ```
   1. User selects tokens and amounts
   2. Parallel API calls fetch swap quotes (fast, before prices move)
   3. Service creates transaction array:
      - ERC20 approval tx for each token
      - Swap tx for each token
   4. Safe SDK bundles all transactions
   5. Multisig signs once for entire bundle
   6. All execute atomically
   ```

### Benefits

- **Simpler**: No custom contract needed
- **Faster**: Parallel API calls
- **Native**: Uses Safe's built-in features
- **Secure**: Standard approve/swap pattern
- **Atomic**: All succeed or all fail

### Code Quality

- All files have LLM-readable comments
- No placeholder data or unnecessary code
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Build ready for deployment

The app is now cleaner, more efficient, and follows Safe App best practices!
